Before diving into sophisticated statistical inference techniques, we should first explore your data by plotting them and computing simple summary statistics. This process, called exploratory data analysis, is a crucial first step in statistical analysis of data. After acquiring data and getting it into a form we can work with, we ultimately want to make clear, succinct conclusions from it. This crucial last step of a data analysis pipeline hinges on the principles of statistical inference. In this course, we built the foundation we need to think statistically, speak the language of your data, and understand what our data is telling us.  We have used '2008 US State Elections Results' dataset here to learn statistical analysis in Python.
